# Custom clickable builder for the Ubuntu Touch click of the OpenJDK port.
#
# Runs inside a CROSS clickable container (amd64 host toolchain, aarch64 target
# sysroot), which is what keeps a rebuild in minutes: nothing is compiled by an
# emulated arm64 toolchain. The split is
#
#   arch-independent, built on the host first (linux-port/build-all.sh):
#       out/classpath/*.jar   the app and its dependencies
#       out/app.apk           resources, assets and the manifest
#   arm64, built here:
#       atlas                 the camera2 branch: framework natives, api-impl.jar
#                             and the HotSpot launcher (javac is a host tool, so
#                             the jar is the same bytecode either way)
#       ncnn                  the inference library the ML nodes link
#       the app's JNI libs    dngCreator, allocator, flacRecorder, camera2native,
#                             ncnnMl — from app/src/main/cpp against glibc
#       shim.jar + libportshim.so  the libcore/dalvik compat shim
#   prebuilt, staged by stage-prebuilt.sh:
#       art support libs, ART's boot jars, dx, the bionic stubs, GLFW,
#       libskia.so and the atlas sources — see PROVENANCE.md
#
# Unlike the sibling Mercurygram click, atlas is always compiled here: the ATL
# SDK is built from atl-touch master and this port stands on the camera2 branch.
# The SDK supplies that build's inputs, not its output.
#
# Every step is stamped in $BUILD_DIR/stamps, so a re-run only redoes what
# changed. The port's own build scripts do the work; this file only retargets
# them (PORT_ARCH=arm64) and assembles the click.

# A jlink image of the modules the app reaches, not a copy of the whole JDK.
# jlink is arch-neutral, so the host one builds the arm64 image out of the arm64
# jmods; nothing here has to run under qemu.
#
# jdeps over classpath/ + api-impl + shim finds java.{base,compiler,instrument,
# sql} and jdk.unsupported (java.xml follows transitively); the rest is what
# static analysis cannot see — locales, charsets, EC for TLS, the JDWP agent the
# launcher's JDWP_LISTEN needs. Re-run this when a dependency is added:
#
#   jdeps --ignore-missing-deps --print-module-deps --multi-release 21 \
#         -cp 'classpath/*:atlas/api-impl.jar' classpath/*.jar atlas/api-impl.jar
#
# A missing module is not a build error — it is a NoClassDefFoundError on
# whatever path first needs it, so keep the set generous.
#
# A jlink image also fixes what --copy-unsafe-links used to paper over: Debian's
# JDK is a tree of symlinks into /etc/java-21-openjdk and /etc/ssl/certs, none of
# which exists on the device. jlink writes real files, including a populated
# cacerts rather than the build host's symlink.
